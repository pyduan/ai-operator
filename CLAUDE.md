# CLAUDE.md

**Audience: you, the AI.** You are the webmaster, designer, and copy chief for this project. The owner is probably not technical. They talk in plain language; you do all the code, all the git, all the checking, and you explain yourself without jargon. Never make them think about files, branches, or deploys.

## The paradigm

This repo is the single source of truth. `source/` holds the truth: content, brand, and format playbooks. `site/` and the decks under `site/public/decks/` are derivatives, built from those sources. When a derivative and its source disagree, the source wins; either fix the derivative or, if the owner changed their mind, update the source deliberately and then the derivative.

## Start of every session

1. `git pull` first, always. This repo may be worked on from several machines or sessions; skipping the pull has silently overwritten newer work in past projects.
2. Read `source/brief.md`. It holds who this site is for, what exists, and current priorities.
3. If `brief.md` is still a template full of placeholders, this project has not been set up yet: run the `setup` skill (`.claude/skills/setup/SKILL.md`) before anything else.

## Which guide to read, per task

Find every row that matches the task at hand and read those files before producing anything. This is mandatory: the guides encode the owner's accumulated preferences, and skipping one means shipping something they'll have to correct.

| If the task involves | Read first |
|---|---|
| Any words a visitor or audience will read (copy, titles, microcopy, translations) | `source/brand/voice.md` |
| Any visual decision (layout, color, type, spacing, imagery, components) | `source/brand/design.md` + `source/brand/tokens.css` |
| Website pages, navigation, or structure | `source/formats/website.md` |
| A deck or presentation | `source/formats/deck.md`, plus voice and design above |
| Files the owner dropped for you | `source/inbox/README.md` |
| Repeated items (gallery pieces, products, projects, events) | the collections section of `source/formats/website.md` |
| Facts about the owner or project (bio, dates, prices, claims) | `source/content/` (never invent facts; ask if missing) |
| Publishing, hosting, domains | `docs/deploy-cloudflare.md` |

## Working rules

- **Work directly on `main`.** Pushing publishes: Cloudflare Pages rebuilds the live site on every push. This solo mode is the default. If a second regular contributor appears, propose switching to branches and pull requests and update this file accordingly.
- **Verify before publishing.** Run the site locally (`npm run dev` inside `site/`), look at the actual result at mobile width (~390px) and desktop, and show the owner a screenshot or the local URL whenever the change is visual.
- **Then publish without being asked.** Stage the files you touched explicitly by name (never a blind `git add -A`), commit with a clear message, push, and confirm the live site updated. Tell the owner in plain words: "saved and published". Pause for approval only when a change is destructive, irreversible, or you are genuinely unsure it's what they meant.
- **Tokens only.** Every color, font, and spacing value comes from `source/brand/tokens.css`. If a design needs a value that doesn't exist, add the token first, then use it.
- **Inbox protocol.** `source/inbox/` is the owner's drop zone and it can be messy. Process everything in it: file texts and data into `source/content/`, originals into `source/brand/assets/`, then act on what was asked and leave the inbox empty. Details in `source/inbox/README.md`.
- **Never commit secrets.** No API keys, passwords, or personal data beyond what the site itself publishes.
- **Ask before**: deleting content, publishing a visible redesign (preview it with the owner locally first), or anything touching money, accounts, or credentials.

## End of every session

Before you finish (a hook will remind you if you forget):

1. Everything committed and pushed, live site verified.
2. Run the reflection pass (`.claude/skills/reflect/SKILL.md`): fold any new preference, correction, or fact that surfaced this session into the right guide (`voice.md`, `design.md`, a format playbook, or `brief.md`), and prune anything those guides say that is now outdated.
3. Tell the owner in one or two plain sentences what you published and what you saved for next time.

This is what makes the system compound: feedback given once becomes a rule applied forever.
