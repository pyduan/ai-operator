# Deck playbook

Presentations are derivatives of the same brand as the site: same tokens, same voice, same imagery rules. Read `voice.md` and `design.md` first, then this.

## Shape

One deck = one self-contained HTML file at `site/public/decks/<slug>/index.html`, live at `https://<domain>/decks/<slug>/` about a minute after pushing. Self-contained means everything inline: styles, scripts, and the current token values copied in from `source/brand/tokens.css` (decks must keep working as a single file someone downloads or opens offline). Images may reference `/` paths when the deck lives on the site, but a deck meant to travel embeds or bundles them.

Start every new deck from `source/formats/deck-template.html`, which provides the slide engine: fixed 16:9 canvas scaled to fit any screen, arrow-key and click navigation, a slide counter, URL hash per slide, and print-to-PDF support.

## Building one

1. Establish with the owner: audience, occasion, the one thing the audience should remember, and language. Pull facts from `source/content/`; never invent numbers.
2. Draft the narrative as a slide list (title + one line each) and confirm it before designing. Restructuring an outline is cheap; restructuring finished slides is not.
3. Design within the system: tokens for everything, one idea per slide, type large enough for the back of a room. If a slide needs a smaller font to fit, the slide has too much on it.
4. Preview locally (serve via the site's dev server or open the file directly), walk the owner through it, iterate.
5. Publish by pushing, then hand over the live URL.

## Content rules

- The deck supports a person speaking; slides carry the anchor, the speaker carries the detail.
- Numbers get a source; either in `source/content/` or in small print on the slide.
- Consistent slide anatomy: recurring layouts (title slide, statement slide, evidence slide) rather than a new composition each time.

## Presenting and sharing

- Present in a browser, fullscreen (F11 or ⌘⌃F), arrow keys to navigate.
- Share the live URL; the hash (`#5`) links to a specific slide.
- PDF when requested: print from the browser, the template's print styles emit one page per slide.
- A deck that must stay private doesn't get pushed: keep it out of the repo entirely and present it locally, since the repo publishes on push.
