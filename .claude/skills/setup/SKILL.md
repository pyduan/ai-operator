description: "First-time project setup: interview the owner, ingest their content (dropped files or a scrape of their existing site), personalize the brand guides, build v1 of the site, and help put it live. Use when source/brief.md still contains TODO placeholders, or when the owner asks to set up or start their site."

# Setup

The founding session. Unlike normal sessions, here you ask questions liberally: everything you learn now becomes guides that every future session runs on. Budget the conversation; batch questions in small, natural groups rather than one long form.

## 1. Interview

Establish, in the owner's own words:

- Who they are and what this site is for (the elevator pitch, the audience, what a visitor should do).
- What pages they imagine (offer a starting set: home, about, work/gallery, contact; fewer is fine).
- Languages, and which is the default.
- The starting point, one of:
  - **an existing live site to replace** (get the URL),
  - **a pile of source documents** (have them drop everything into `source/inbox/`),
  - **nothing yet** (interview a bit deeper and draft for them).
- Taste: sites or brands they admire, colors and fonts they love or hate, photos of their work if relevant. Concrete references beat adjectives.
- Domain: do they own one, where is it registered. (Setup works fine before the domain exists; the site lives on a `.pages.dev` URL meanwhile.)
- Any recurring content: gallery, products, events. These become collections.

## 2. Ingest

**Existing site**: fetch every reachable page of the old site. Save each page's copy as markdown in `source/content/` (one file per page, marked with provenance and date). Download the images worth keeping into `source/brand/assets/`. Record observed design cues (palette, type feel, layout habits) as a starting proposal for the design guide; the owner may want continuity or a clean break, so ask which.

**Inbox**: process per `source/inbox/README.md`. Read everything before filing anything, since documents explain each other.

Facts you couldn't verify get a `<!-- verify -->` marker in the content files.

## 3. Gap check: clarify what you already have

Between ingesting and writing any guide, take stock. For each of the four targets below, note what the material already answers (and where that came from) and what is missing or uncertain, then close the gaps with the owner in one or two batched rounds of questions. Ground every question in something specific you found; "your old site says the studio opened in 2019, is that still right?" gets a better answer than "tell me about your history". And prefer proposing over interrogating: show the three colors you extracted and ask keep or change, draft the bio from their documents and ask what's wrong with it.

- **Facts and content** (`source/content/`): bio, dates, prices, claims, contact details. Everything scraped or inferred gets confirmed now or keeps its `<!-- verify -->` marker.
- **Voice** (`voice.md`): the tone you observed in their material versus the tone they want; words they reach for; words to ban; the exact notation of the project name.
- **Design** (`design.md` + `tokens.css`): the palette, type, and layout cues you extracted; continuity with the old look or a clean break; references they admire.
- **Brief** (`brief.md`): audience, what a visitor should do, current priorities.

Where the interface offers structured questions (AskUserQuestion), use it with concrete options. Don't move on while a guide would still contain a guess on something the owner could settle in one sentence.

## 4. Personalize the system

Replace every TODO in these files with what you learned, keeping each file's structure:

- `source/brief.md`, complete and current; it's the first thing every future session reads.
- `source/brand/voice.md`: tone words with meanings, banned words, notation of the project name, languages.
- `source/brand/design.md`: the philosophy paragraph, type choices, imagery style.
- `source/brand/tokens.css`: the real palette and fonts. If using webfonts, self-host them per the design guide.

Read each personalized guide back as a whole; it must read as this project's guide, with no template smell left.

## 5. Build v1

Build the site in `site/` per `source/formats/website.md`: layout shell first (nav, footer, typography on tokens), then pages, then collections if any. Replace the placeholder home page. Run `npm install` and `npm run dev` inside `site/`, verify at mobile and desktop widths, then review it with the owner page by page (share the local URL, show screenshots). Iterate until they're happy; this loop is most of the session.

## 6. Go live

Walk the owner (or their helper) through `docs/deploy-cloudflare.md` while they click. Commit and push everything first so Cloudflare has something to build. Once the `.pages.dev` URL is live, verify it yourself, record the URLs in `brief.md`, and continue to the domain if they own one.

## 7. Close

Run the reflect skill (it will have plenty to record from this session), push everything, and tell the owner what exists now: the live URL, what each folder is for in one line each, and how to work with you from now on (open the folder, run `claude`, talk, drop files in the inbox).
