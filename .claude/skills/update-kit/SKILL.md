# Update the framework in this project

This project was created from the `pyduan/agentic-organization` template. The template keeps
improving (new skills, better guides, fixed scripts). This skill pulls those improvements in
**without clobbering the owner's own content** — their `source/`, their `site/`, their pages are
theirs; the *framework scaffolding* (`.claude/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, the format playbooks in
`source/formats/`, the root `CLAUDE.md`/`SETUP.md`/`README.md`) is what gets refreshed.

**The golden distinction.** Two kinds of files live here:
- **Framework** (comes from the template, safe to update): `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/hooks/`,
  `docs/`, `scripts/`, `source/formats/*.md`, and the root `CLAUDE.md` / `SETUP.md` / `README.md`.
- **The owner's** (never overwrite): everything under `source/` *except* `source/formats/`
  (so `brief.md`, `content/`, `facts/`, `brand/`, `inbox/`), all of `site/`, `apps/`, and
  `site/public/decks/`.

## Steps

1. **Safety first.** `git -C <repo> status`. If there's uncommitted work, commit it (or stash with
   `-u`) before touching anything — the owner's in-progress edits must survive.
2. **Add the template as a remote** (once): `git remote add template
   https://github.com/pyduan/agentic-organization.git` (skip if it already exists), then
   `git fetch template`.
3. **Bring in framework files only.** Don't merge the whole template (it would fight the owner's
   content and history). Instead, check out just the framework paths from the template's main:
   `git checkout template/main -- .claude docs scripts source/formats SETUP.md README.md`
   Leave `CLAUDE.md` for step 4 (it may carry local rules the owner added).
   Also compare the template's `.gitignore` with this project's and merge in any rules the
   template added for local-only folders (the team module's `team/*` + `!team/README.md`):
   those rules are a privacy guarantee, and an updated skill must never run without them.
4. **Reconcile `CLAUDE.md` by reading, not overwriting.** Diff the template's `CLAUDE.md` against
   this one (`git diff --no-index CLAUDE.md <(git show template/main:CLAUDE.md)`), and fold in the
   new framework rules while **keeping any project-specific rules** the owner or you added over
   time. Same for `README.md`/`SETUP.md` if the owner personalised them.
5. **Re-apply the owner's work on top.** The owner's `source/` (minus `formats/`), `site/`, and
   `apps/` were never touched, so nothing to re-apply there. But if a framework change *implies*
   follow-up (a new format playbook, a renamed skill, a changed folder), do that follow-up now:
   re-read the refreshed guides and bring the site/content into line where it's cheap and safe
   (e.g. a new `source/facts/` folder → offer to populate it; a new `apps/` convention → note it;
   the update introduced the `projects` and `team` modules → mention them in one sentence each and
   offer to activate, creating `source/objectives.md` from the template if the owner wants
   prioritization against a north star).
   One follow-up needs care: **the deploy default moved to Cloudflare Workers (from Pages).** The
   refreshed `docs/deploy-cloudflare.md` now describes Workers, but `site/wrangler.jsonc` is project
   config living in `site/` (like `astro.config.mjs`), so this update does **not** bring it in. If
   the owner still publishes through Cloudflare Pages, their live site keeps working untouched (the
   doc's "Already publishing with Cloudflare Pages?" section explains why, and how to migrate when
   they choose). Point them there; only when they decide to migrate do you add `site/wrangler.jsonc`
   with their project name and walk them through the dashboard steps. Don't force the switch.
   Show the owner what changed and what you propose to redo; don't silently rewrite their pages.
6. **Verify + publish.** `npm run build` inside `site/` is green, run it locally, then commit
   ("chore: update framework from template") and push, per the `publish` skill. Tell the owner in
   plain words what improved and anything they should look at.

## If the merge gets messy

The template and this project have unrelated histories, so a plain `git merge template/main` will
conflict heavily — **don't**. The path-scoped `git checkout template/main -- <paths>` above avoids
that entirely: it only touches framework files. If a framework file was locally customised and you
don't want to lose that, diff it first (`git show template/main:<path>`) and merge by hand.

## Telling other people on the same project

If teammates cloned this repo, they just `git pull` — the framework update rode in with the owner's
push. If someone has **their own project** from the same template and wants these improvements, they
run this skill in *their* repo (their `source/`/`site/` stay untouched; only the framework refreshes).
