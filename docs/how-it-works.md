# How this works

The mental model behind the kit, for humans. The AI's version of this is `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root.

## One source of truth, many derivatives

Everything that defines your presence lives in `source/` as plain files you could read in any text editor: your texts and facts (`content/`), how you write (`brand/voice.md`), how you look (`brand/design.md` and `tokens.css`), and how each output format is built (`formats/`). The website and the decks are derivatives: rebuilt from those sources, never the other way around.

This is why the system stays coherent as it grows. Change the accent color once in `tokens.css` and the site and every future deck follow. Ban a buzzword once in `voice.md` and it never comes back.

A shared Drive or Dropbox can still be a doorway in: drop documents there or in `source/inbox/` and the AI ingests them. But those spaces are never the source of truth, and the AI never writes back to them. They're built for people, with no real version history and only coarse "who can open this folder" access. The AI curates the truth in the repo instead, through Git, where every change is versioned, attributed, and reversible, and access is fine-grained (who can read, who can write, who can publish). That's both clearer and more secure than a shared folder that slowly fills with `v3_final(2).docx`. Drive feeds the system; Git is what it stands on.

## The AI is the operator, the repo is its manual

`CLAUDE.md` tells the AI, for every kind of task, exactly which guide to read first. You never need to say "remember, we don't use exclamation points": the voice guide says it, the AI reads the voice guide before writing, so it applies. When you give feedback in a session, the AI folds it into the right guide before it signs off, so the correction sticks for every future session, on any machine.

## Git, invisibly

Git gives the system its memory: every change to every file, forever, with the reason attached. You don't operate it; the AI pulls at the start of each session, commits and pushes at the end of each change. Two things follow that are worth knowing:

- Nothing is ever lost. "Put the gallery back how it was in June" is a valid request.
- Pushing is publishing. Cloudflare Pages watches the repo and rebuilds the live site on every push, in about a minute.

## Trust boundaries

The AI publishes routine changes on its own; that's the point. It's instructed to pause and ask for anything destructive, any visible redesign, and anything touching money, accounts, or credentials. Secrets never go in the repo.

## When the project outgrows solo mode

The kit is tuned for one owner (with the AI doing the work). When a second regular contributor joins, the sane next step is the one bigger organizations use: contributors work on branches, changes become pull requests, one person merges. Ask the AI to set that up; the switch is one conversation. The same escalation exists for content (from data files to a real CMS) and for features (forms, shops); start simple, upgrade when reality asks for it.

## Governance is part of the setup, in plain terms

Running an organization from a repo raises the same questions any shared system does, and git happens to have precise answers. In plain terms:

- **Who owns the vault** — the GitHub and Cloudflare accounts belong to the owner, never to a helper or vendor. That's the whole point of owning your source of truth.
- **Who can look** — read access: they can see everything, change nothing.
- **Who can propose** — write access: they (or their AI session) can push branches and open pull requests, but nothing they do goes live.
- **Who publishes** — merge rights: whoever can merge to `main` publishes, because pushing is publishing. Solo mode collapses all of this into one person; team mode separates proposing from publishing.

The setup interview asks these questions in exactly these terms and records the answers in `source/brief.md` ▸ Governance. Scope rights to the actual use case, not to trust in the abstract: a helper who only edits copy needs write, not admin; a reviewer needs merge, not admin; almost nobody needs admin. Revisit the section whenever someone new joins.

## Lineage

The rules in these guides are distilled from real projects: a multi-contributor organization site with a design system and a deck engine (where the guide-routing and reflection habits come from), an artist's gallery and shop updated weekly through an inbox folder (the inbox protocol and the publish-without-being-asked rule), a brand built from source documents before any website existed (brand kit first, derivatives after), and small personal sites (the bias for fewer moving parts).
